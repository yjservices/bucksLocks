Send Gmail from GoDaddy, Bluehost and other hosts that block the standard email ports with this add-on for the Postman SMTP plugin.

== Description ==

###* Please read before downloading *
> This plugin is deprecated as of May 3rd, 2015. The functionality previously provided has been merged into the [Postman SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/) plugin, v1.6. That single package is all you need to send your Gmail from web hosts that block your access to remote SMTP servers. If you previously installed this plugin, you may remove it. See [this post](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/postman-gmail-api-extension-is-deprecated?replies=1) for more information.

Can't send Gmail because ports 465 and 587 are blocked on your host? No problem! The Postman Gmail API Extension works in combination with [Postman SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/) to send your mail out on the HTTPS port, port 443. Even if you host your site on GoDaddy or Bluehost, your Gmail will be delivered!

The Postman Gmail API Extension includes the **Google APIs Client Library for PHP**. The [Google API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/) does not support password-based authentication and Postman will guide you in creating a (free) [Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2).


= Features =
* Send Gmail from your WordPress site over HTTPS
* Available translations: English, French, Italian

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= What is Postman? =

The first and only WordPress plugin to allow sending mail with OAuth 2.0; Google, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail's preferred authentication mechanism. Email delivery problems are now a thing of the past.

= What URI do I enter to whitelist the plugin? =

If your WordPress site is configured with WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL to prevent outbound connections, you may exempt the Gmail APIs with this definition:

> define('WP_ACCESSIBLE_HOSTS', 'www.googleapis.com');

= What is a Client ID? =
To use OAuth, your website needs it's own Client ID. The Client ID is used to control authentication and authorization and is tied to the specific URL of your website. If you manage several website, you will need a different Client ID for each one.

= How do I get a Google Client ID? =
1. Go to [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and choose 'Create Project', or use an existing project if you have one.
1. If you have previously created a project, select it from the Projects page and you will arrive at the Project Dashboard. If you have just created a project, you are brought to the Project Dashboard automatically.
1. If you have not filled out the consent screen for this project, do it now. In the left-hand hand navigation menu, select 'Consent Screen' from under 'APIs & auth'. Into 'email address' put your Gmail address and in 'product name' put 'Postman SMTP'. Choose 'Save'.
